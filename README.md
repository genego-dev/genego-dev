My name is Edwin I am a software developer from the Netherlands. I have been learning CS and Programming for the past 5+ years, and am always looking for new challenges to master. I'm a experienced sys-admin with a background as a hardware technician. Currently employed as a backend-dev working with Python & Django. Lately I have also been spending a lot of time working on front-end apps, going down the path of solo full-stack development.
