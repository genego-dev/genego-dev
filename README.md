# Hello, folks!

My name is Edwin Genego, I am a software developer from the Netherlands. I have been learning CS and Programming for the past 5+ years, and am always looking for new challenges to master. I'm currently employed as Jr. Backend Developer, working with Python, Django and the Django-rest-framework. But I am also slowly getting the hang of HTML/CSS & Javascript while building full-stack applications.
